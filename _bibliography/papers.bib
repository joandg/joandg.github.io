    abstract = {Most satellites decouple the acquisition of a panchromatic image at high spatial resolution from the acquisition of a multispectral image at lower spatial resolution. Pansharpening is a fusion technique used to increase the spatial resolution of the multispectral data while simultaneously preserving its spectral information. In this paper, we consider pansharpening as an optimization problem minimizing a cost function with a nonlocal regularization term. The energy functional which is to be minimized decouples for each band, thus permitting the application to misregistered spectral components. This requirement is achieved by dropping the, commonly used, assumption that relates the spectral and panchromatic modalities by a linear transformation. Instead, a new constraint that preserves the radiometric ratio between the panchromatic and each spectral component is introduced. An exhaustive performance comparison of the proposed fusion method with several classical and state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques illustrates its superiority in preserving spatial details, reducing color distortions, and avoiding the creation of aliasing artifacts.},

    abstract = {The goal of super-resolution is to fuse several low-resolution images of the same scene into a single one with increased resolution. The classical formulation assumes that the super-resolved image is related to the low-resolution frames by warping, convolution and subsampling. Algorithms divide into those using explicit registration and those avoiding it. The ﬁrst ones combine for each pixel the information in its estimated trajectory. The second ones exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy. We propose to combine both ideas, making use of optical ﬂow and exploiting spatio-temporal redundancy with patch-based techniques. The proposed non-linear ﬁltering takes into account patch similarities, automatically correcting the ﬂow inaccuracies and avoiding the need of occlusion detection. Total variation and nonlocal regularization are used for the deconvolution stage.},

    abstract = {Even after two decades, the total variation (TV) remains one of the most popular regularizations for image processing problems and has sparked a tremendous amount of research, particularly on moving from scalar to vector-valued functions. In this paper, we consider the gradient of a color image as a three-dimensional matrix or tensor with dimensions corresponding to the spatial extent, the intensity differences between neighboring pixels, and the spectral channels. The smoothness of this tensor is then measured by taking different norms along the different dimensions. Depending on the types of these norms, one obtains very different properties of the regularization, leading to novel models for color images. We call this class of regularizations collaborative total variation (CTV). On the theoretical side, we characterize the dual norm, the subdifferential, and the proximal mapping of the proposed regularizers. We further prove, with the help of the generalized concept of singular vectors, that an $l^{\infty}$ channel coupling makes the most prior assumptions and has the greatest potential to reduce color artifacts. Our practical contributions consist of an extensive experimental section, where we compare the performance of a large number of collaborative TV methods for inverse problems such as denoising, deblurring, and inpainting.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel framework for restoring color images using nonlocal total variation (NLTV) regularization. We observe that the discrete local and nonlocal gradient of a color image can be viewed as a 3D matrix or tensor with dimensions corresponding to the spatial extend, the differences to other pixels, and the color channels. Based on this observation we obtain a new class of NLTV methods by penalizing the $l^{p,q,r}$ norm of this 3D tensor. Interestingly, this unifies several local color total variation (TV) methods in a single framework. We show in several numerical experiments on image denoising and deblurring that a stronger coupling of different color channels – particularly, a coupling with the $l^{\infty}$ norm – yields superior reconstruction results.},

    abstract = {Image restoration is the problem of recovering an original image from an observation of it in order to extract the most meaningful information. In this paper, we study this problem from a variational point of view through the minimization of energies composed of a quadratic data-fidelity term and a nonsmooth nonconvex regularization term. In the discrete setting, existence of minimizer is proved for arbitrary linear operators. For this kind of problems, fully segmented solutions can be found by minimizing objective nonconvex functionals. We propose a dual formulation of the model by introducing an auxiliary variable with a double function. On one hand, it marks the edges and it ensures their preservation from smoothing. On the other hand, it makes the criterion half-linear in the sense that the dual energy depends linearly on the gradient of the image to be recovered. This leads to design an efficient optimization algorithm with wide applicability to several image restoration tasks such as denoising and deconvolution. Finally, we present experimental results and we compare them with TV-based image restoration algorithms.}

    abstract = {Most common cameras use a CCD sensor device measuring a single color per pixel. The other two color values of each pixel must be interpolated from the neighboring pixels in the so-called demosaicking process. State-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms take advantage of interchannel correlation locally selecting the best interpolation direction. These methods give impressive results except when local geometry cannot be inferred from neighboring pixels or channel correlation is low. In these cases, they create interpolation artifacts. We introduce a new algorithm involving nonlocal image self-similarity in order to reduce interpolation artifacts when local geometry is ambiguous. The proposed algorithm introduces a clear and intuitive manner of balancing how much channel-correlation must be taken advantage of. Comparison shows that the proposed algorithm gives state-of-the-art methods in several image bases.},

In this paper we propose a new variational method for pansharpening which incorporates a nonlocal regularization term and two fidelity terms, one describing the relation between the panchromatic image and the high-resolution spectral channels and the other one preserving the colors from the low-resolution modality. The nonlocal term is based on the image self-similarity principle applied to the panchromatic image. The existence and uniqueness of minimizer for the described functional is proved in a suitable space of weighted integrable functions. Although quite successful in terms of relative error, state-of-the-art pansharpening methods introduce relevant color artifacts. These spectral distortions can be significantly reduced by involving the image self-similarity. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are performed.},

The standard noise model is additive white Gaussian noise, where the observed image f is related to the underlying true image u by the degradation model $f=u+\eta$, and $\eta$~is supposed to be at each pixel independently and identically distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. Since this is an ill-posed problem, Rudin, Osher and Fatemi introduced the total variation as a regularizing term. It has proved to be quite efficient for regularizing images without smoothing the boundaries of the objects. This paper focuses on the simple description of the theory and on the implementation of Chambolle's projection algorithm for minimizing the total variation of a grayscale image. Furthermore, we adapt the algorithm to the vectorial total variation for color images. The implementation is described in detail and its parameters are analyzed and varied to come up with a reliable implementation.},
