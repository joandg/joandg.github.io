    abstract = {Pansharpening refers to the fusion process of inferring a high-resolution multispectral image from a high-resolution panchromatic image and a low-resolution multispectral one. In this paper we propose a new variational method for pansharpening which incorporates a nonlocal regularization term and two fidelity terms, one describing the relation between the panchromatic image and the high-resolution spectral channels and the other one preserving the colors from the low-resolution modality. The nonlocal term is based on the image self-similarity principle applied to the panchromatic image. The existence and uniqueness of minimizer for the described functional is proved in a suitable space of weighted integrable functions. Although quite successful in terms of relative error, state-of-the-art pansharpening methods introduce relevant color artifacts. These spectral distortions can be significantly reduced by involving the image self-similarity. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are performed.},

    abstract = {Denoising is the problem of removing the inherent noise from an image. The standard noise model is additive white Gaussian noise, where the observed image f is related to the underlying true image u by the degradation model $f=u+\eta$, and $\eta$ is supposed to be at each pixel independently and identically distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. Since this is an ill-posed problem, Rudin, Osher and Fatemi introduced the total variation as a regularizing term. It has proved to be quite efficient for regularizing images without smoothing the boundaries of the objects. This paper focuses on the simple description of the theory and on the implementation of Chambolle's projection algorithm for minimizing the total variation of a grayscale image. Furthermore, we adapt the algorithm to the vectorial total variation for color images. The implementation is described in detail and its parameters are analyzed and varied to come up with a reliable implementation.},
