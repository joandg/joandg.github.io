    abstract = {Pansharpening aims to fuse the geometry of a high-resolution panchromatic image with the color information of a low-resolution multispectral image to generate a high-resolution multispectral image. Classical variational methods are more interpretable and flexible than pure deep learning approaches, but their performance is limited by the use of rigid priors. In this paper, we efficiently combine both techniques by introducing a shallow residual network to learn the regularization term of a variational pansharpening model. The proposed energy includes the classical observation model for the multispectral data and a constraint to preserve the geometry encoded in the panchromatic. The experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.}

    abstract = {The fusion of multi-source data with different spatial and spectral resolutions is a crucial task in many remote sensing and computer vision applications. Model-based fusion methods are more interpretable and flexible than pure data-driven learning networks, however, their performance depends greatly on the established fusion model and the hand-crafted prior. In this work, we propose an end-to-end trainable model-based network for hyperspectral and panchromatic image fusion. We introduce an energy functional that takes into account classical observation models and incorporates a high-frequency details injection constraint. The resulting optimization function is solved by a forward-backward splitting algorithm and unfolded into a deep-learning framework that uses two modules trained in parallel to ensure both data observation fitting and constraint compliance. Extensive experiments are conducted on the remote-sensing hyperspectral PRISMA dataset and on the CAVE dataset, proving the superiority of the proposed deep unfolding network both qualitatively and quantitatively.}

In particular, we study the suitability of exploit- ing self-similarity of natural images in the fidelity term. Tra- ditionally, this cue has been used for the regularization term, promoting to align similarities in the degraded image with similarities in the restored one. In contrast, our proposed non- local data-fidelity term penalizes deviations of patches after having suffered from the degradation process if they are sim- ilar in the degraded image. Experiments on super-resolution, denoising and depth filtering show the competitiveness of this new formulation with respect to traditional nonlocal regular- ization terms and recent learning-based methods.}

Hyperspectral image fusion consists in merging the spectral information of a hyperspectral image with the geometry of a multispectral one in order to infer an image with high spatial and spectral resolutions. In this paper, we propose a variational fusion model with a nonlocal regularization term that encodes patch-based filtering conditioned to the geometry of the multispectral data. We further incorporate a radiometric constraint that injects the high frequencies of the scene into the fused product with a band per band modulation according to the energy levels of the multispectral and hyperspectral images. The proposed approach proved robust to noise and aliasing. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of our method with respect to the state-of-the-art techniques on data acquired by commercial hyperspectral cameras and Earth observation satellites.},

These methods normally involve a validation process and provide a non-completely dense solution. In this paper, we propose a novel refinement and completion approach for registration. The proposed model combines single image nonlocal densification with classical variational image registration. We associate a total variation regularization with a nonlocal term to provide a smooth solution leveraging the image geometry. We show experiments on public stereo and optical flow datasets to filter and densify incomplete depth maps and motion fields. Extensive comparisons against existing and state-of-the-art depth/motion fields densification approaches demonstrate the competitive performance of the introduced method. Additionally, we illustrate how our method can deal with other tasks, such as filtering and interpolation of depth maps from RGBD data and depth upsampling.}

The reconstruction errors during these stages will have undesirable effects on the final result if not handled properly. Demosaicking provokes the spatial and color correlation of noise, which is afterwards enhanced by the processing pipeline. This structured noise generally degrades the image quality and, for dark scenes with low signal to noise ratio, prevents the correct interpretation of the image. When trying to mitigate such structured noise on already processed data, denoising methods attenuate details and texture. We present a video processing chain, consisting of a novel strategy for the removal of noise at the camera sensor and a novel video demosaicking algorithm. In both cases, a spatio-temporal patch-based filter with motion compensation is introduced. The experimental results, including real examples, illustrate the performance of the proposed chain, avoiding the creation of interpolation artefacts and colored spots.},

    abstract = {The classical multi-image super-resolution model assumes that the super-resolved image is related to the low-resolution frames by warping, convolution and downsampling. State-of-the-art algorithms either use explicit registration to fuse the information for each pixel in its trajectory or exploit spatial and temporal similarities. We propose to combine both ideas, making use of inter-frame motion and exploiting spatio-temporal redundancy with patch-based techniques. We introduce a non-linear filtering approach that combines patches from several frames not necessarily belonging to the same pixel trajectory. The selection of candidate patches depends on a motion-compensated 3D distance, which is robust to noise and aliasing. The selected 3D volumes are then sliced per frame, providing a collection of 2D patches which are finally averaged depending on their similarity to the reference one. This makes the upsampling strategy robust to flow inaccuracies and occlusions. Total variation and nonlocal regularization are used in the deconvolution stage. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method for the super-resolution of videos and light-field images. We also adapt our approach to multimodal sequences when some additional data at the desired resolution is available.}

The structural component is then replaced by the locally histogram-matched PAN for spatial enhancement. Experimental results illustrate the efficiency of the proposed restoration chain.},

    abstract = {Most satellites decouple the acquisition of a panchromatic image at high spatial resolution from the acquisition of a multispectral image at lower spatial resolution. Pansharpening is a fusion technique used to increase the spatial resolution of the multispectral data while simultaneously preserving its spectral information. In this paper, we consider pansharpening as an optimization problem minimizing a cost function with a nonlocal regularization term. The energy functional which is to be minimized decouples for each band, thus permitting the application to misregistered spectral components. This requirement is achieved by dropping the, commonly used, assumption that relates the spectral and panchromatic modalities by a linear transformation. Instead, a new constraint that preserves the radiometric ratio between the panchromatic and each spectral component is introduced. An exhaustive performance comparison of the proposed fusion method with several classical and state-of-the-art pansharpening techniques illustrates its superiority in preserving spatial details, reducing color distortions, and avoiding the creation of aliasing artifacts.},

    abstract = {Even after two decades, the total variation (TV) remains one of the most popular regularizations for image processing problems and has sparked a tremendous amount of research, particularly on moving from scalar to vector-valued functions. In this paper, we consider the gradient of a color image as a three-dimensional matrix or tensor with dimensions corresponding to the spatial extent, the intensity differences between neighboring pixels, and the spectral channels. The smoothness of this tensor is then measured by taking different norms along the different dimensions. Depending on the types of these norms, one obtains very different properties of the regularization, leading to novel models for color images. We call this class of regularizations collaborative total variation (CTV). On the theoretical side, we characterize the dual norm, the subdifferential, and the proximal mapping of the proposed regularizers. We further prove, with the help of the generalized concept of singular vectors, that an $l^{\infty}$ channel coupling makes the most prior assumptions and has the greatest potential to reduce color artifacts. Our practical contributions consist of an extensive experimental section, where we compare the performance of a large number of collaborative TV methods for inverse problems such as denoising, deblurring, and inpainting.},

Based on this observation we obtain a new class of NLTV methods by penalizing the $l^{p,q,r}$ norm of this 3D tensor. Interestingly, this unifies several local color total variation (TV) methods in a single framework.

    abstract = {Image restoration is the problem of recovering an original image from an observation of it in order to extract the most meaningful information. In this paper, we study this problem from a variational point of view through the minimization of energies composed of a quadratic data-fidelity term and a nonsmooth nonconvex regularization term. In the discrete setting, existence of minimizer is proved for arbitrary linear operators. For this kind of problems, fully segmented solutions can be found by minimizing objective nonconvex functionals. We propose a dual formulation of the model by introducing an auxiliary variable with a double function. On one hand, it marks the edges and it ensures their preservation from smoothing. On the other hand, it makes the criterion half-linear in the sense that the dual energy depends linearly on the gradient of the image to be recovered. This leads to design an efficient optimization algorithm with wide applicability to several image restoration tasks such as denoising and deconvolution. Finally, we present experimental results and we compare them with TV-based image restoration algorithms.}

    abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dual algorithm for the minimization of discrete nonconvex functionals, called half-linear regularization. Our approach alternates the calculation of a explicit weight with the minimization of a convex functional with respect to the solution. This minimization corresponds to the weighted total variation which is solved via the well-known Chambolle's algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results by applying it to some image restoration problems as denoising and deconvolution.},

    abstract = {Most common cameras use a CCD sensor device measuring a single color per pixel. The other two color values of each pixel must be interpolated from the neighboring pixels in the so-called demosaicking process. State-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms take advantage of interchannel correlation locally selecting the best interpolation direction. These methods give impressive results except when local geometry cannot be inferred from neighboring pixels or channel correlation is low. In these cases, they create interpolation artifacts. We introduce a new algorithm involving nonlocal image self-similarity in order to reduce interpolation artifacts when local geometry is ambiguous. The proposed algorithm introduces a clear and intuitive manner of balancing how much channel-correlation must be taken advantage of. Comparison shows that the proposed algorithm gives state-of-the-art methods in several image bases.},

    abstract = {Pansharpening refers to the fusion process of inferring a high-resolution multispectral image from a high-resolution panchromatic image and a low-resolution multispectral one. In this paper we propose a new variational method for pansharpening which incorporates a nonlocal regularization term and two fidelity terms, one describing the relation between the panchromatic image and the high-resolution spectral channels and the other one preserving the colors from the low-resolution modality. The nonlocal term is based on the image self-similarity principle applied to the panchromatic image. The existence and uniqueness of minimizer for the described functional is proved in a suitable space of weighted integrable functions. Although quite successful in terms of relative error, state-of-the-art pansharpening methods introduce relevant color artifacts. These spectral distortions can be significantly reduced by involving the image self-similarity. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are performed.},

    abstract = {Denoising is the problem of removing the inherent noise from an image. The standard noise model is additive white Gaussian noise, where the observed image f is related to the underlying true image u by the degradation model $f=u+\eta$, and $\eta$~is supposed to be at each pixel independently and identically distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. Since this is an ill-posed problem, Rudin, Osher and Fatemi introduced the total variation as a regularizing term. It has proved to be quite efficient for regularizing images without smoothing the boundaries of the objects. This paper focuses on the simple description of the theory and on the implementation of Chambolle's projection algorithm for minimizing the total variation of a grayscale image. Furthermore, we adapt the algorithm to the vectorial total variation for color images. The implementation is described in detail and its parameters are analyzed and varied to come up with a reliable implementation.},
