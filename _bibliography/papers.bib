    abstract = {Image restoration is the problem of recovering an original image from an observation of it in order to extract the most meaningful information. In this paper, we study this problem from a variational point of view through the minimization of energies composed of a quadratic data-fidelity term and a nonsmooth nonconvex regularization term. In the discrete setting, existence of minimizer is proved for arbitrary linear operators. For this kind of problems, fully segmented solutions can be found by minimizing objective nonconvex functionals. We propose a dual formulation of the model by introducing an auxiliary variable with a double function. On one hand, it marks the edges and it ensures their preservation from smoothing. On the other hand, it makes the criterion half-linear in the sense that the dual energy depends linearly on the gradient of the image to be recovered. This leads to design an efficient optimization algorithm with wide applicability to several image restoration tasks such as denoising and deconvolution. Finally, we present experimental results and we compare them with TV-based image restoration algorithms.}

    abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new dual algorithm for the minimization of discrete nonconvex functionals, called half-linear regularization. Our approach alternates the calculation of a explicit weight with the minimization of a convex functional with respect to the solution. This minimization corresponds to the weighted total variation which is solved via the well-known Chambolle's algorithm. Finally, we present experimental results by applying it to some image restoration problems as denoising and deconvolution.},

    abstract = {Most common cameras use a CCD sensor device measuring a single color per pixel. The other two color values of each pixel must be interpolated from the neighboring pixels in the so-called demosaicking process. State-of-the-art demosaicking algorithms take advantage of interchannel correlation locally selecting the best interpolation direction. These methods give impressive results except when local geometry cannot be inferred from neighboring pixels or channel correlation is low. In these cases, they create interpolation artifacts. We introduce a new algorithm involving nonlocal image self-similarity in order to reduce interpolation artifacts when local geometry is ambiguous. The proposed algorithm introduces a clear and intuitive manner of balancing how much channel-correlation must be taken advantage of. Comparison shows that the proposed algorithm gives state-of-the-art methods in several image bases.},

    abstract = {Pansharpening refers to the fusion process of inferring a high-resolution multispectral image from a high-resolution panchromatic image and a low-resolution multispectral one. In this paper we propose a new variational method for pansharpening which incorporates a nonlocal regularization term and two fidelity terms, one describing the relation between the panchromatic image and the high-resolution spectral channels and the other one preserving the colors from the low-resolution modality. The nonlocal term is based on the image self-similarity principle applied to the panchromatic image. The existence and uniqueness of minimizer for the described functional is proved in a suitable space of weighted integrable functions. Although quite successful in terms of relative error, state-of-the-art pansharpening methods introduce relevant color artifacts. These spectral distortions can be significantly reduced by involving the image self-similarity. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms are performed.},

    abstract = {Denoising is the problem of removing the inherent noise from an image. The standard noise model is additive white Gaussian noise, where the observed image f is related to the underlying true image u by the degradation model $f=u+\eta$, and $\eta$ is supposed to be at each pixel independently and identically distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable. Since this is an ill-posed problem, Rudin, Osher and Fatemi introduced the total variation as a regularizing term. It has proved to be quite efficient for regularizing images without smoothing the boundaries of the objects. This paper focuses on the simple description of the theory and on the implementation of Chambolle's projection algorithm for minimizing the total variation of a grayscale image. Furthermore, we adapt the algorithm to the vectorial total variation for color images. The implementation is described in detail and its parameters are analyzed and varied to come up with a reliable implementation.},
