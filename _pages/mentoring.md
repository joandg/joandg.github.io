<p>Life as a scientist is incredibly rewarding - I often feel that I am being paid to indulge in an exciting hobby. Being able to perceive the frontier of human knowledge is exhilarating. If I am lucky, I will push it a teensy bit.</p>

<p>I am committed to supporting students as they explore science as a profession. I will be happy to meet with you and chat about being a scientist, what can you do to be a successful one, and academic life in general. Sometimes, I also advise research projects in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) that align with my research and personal interests.</p>

<p>I am firm believer in equitable science and want to support people from diverse backgrounds in accessing scientific and technology spaces. Scientific enquiry is most productive when the researchers are drawn from a variety of cultures and experiences. Diversity expands the frontier of human knowledge we are exploring as a community - people from varying backgrounds are motivated to study different problems. Additionally, diversity ensures that the fruits of effort are accessible to and benefit a greater portion of humanity.</p>

<p>If you are a student (especially in a developing part of the world) and would like to talk, please email me with a brief description of who you are and why you would like to pursue a profession in science. As my expertise is in AI and ML, I am most comfortable discussing that space. I speak Hindi and English fluently.</p>

<p>If you are a BSc/MSc student at UIB interested in pursuing your degree/master thesis in any of my fields of research or in Functional Analysis, Partial Differential Equations or Calculus of Variations, visit my teaching page.</p>

<p>If you are a BCs/MCs/PhD student looking for a research internship, contact me by email.</p>
