I am a tenure-track associate professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)]{https://www.uib.eu/}. I am a member of the {Mathematical Image Processing (TAMI)]{http://tami.uib.es} research group and of the [Institute of Applied Computing and Community Code (IAC3)]{http://iac3.uib.es}.

<p>BSc in Mathematics (2010) by the Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB), MSc in Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering (2011) by the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), and PhD in Mathematics (2016) by the UIB with a tesis on variational models for ill-posed inverse problems in digital imaging. From 2011 to 2015, he had a fellowship of the Govern de les Illes Balears for the realization of his PhD thesis. Since 2015, he is a professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at UIB, currently as tenure-track associate professor.</p>
<p>His main research interests include variational methods, optimization techniques and deep learning based algorithms for solving inverse problems in computer vision, image and video processing. He has taken part in several national research projects and he has collaborated with the french spatial agency (CNES) by contributing to the image restoration chain of the Earth observation satellite Pléiades. He has published several papers in journals indexed by JCR and has participated in several international conferences.</p>
<p>He has been a visiting researcher in the groups headed by <a href="https://vision.in.tum.de/" target="_blank">Prof. Daniel Cremers</a> (Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany), <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan" target="_blank">Prof. Jean-Michel Morel</a> (ENS Cachan, Paris, France), and <a href="https://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/" target="_blank">Prof. Joan Bruna</a> (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences &amp; Center for Data Science, New York University, New York, USA).</p>
<p>He has taught at the <a href="https://eps.uib.es/" target="_blank">Higher Polytechnic School</a> and at the <a href="https://fciencies.uib.cat/" target="_blank">Faculty of Science</a>, mainly in mathematical analysis and differential equations in the degrees in Mathematics, Computer Engineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry. He also teaches mathematical models for the restoration of digital images in the Master's Degree in Advanced Physics and Applied Mathematics.</p>
<p>From July 2021, he is deputy director of the Higher Polytechnic School and head of studies of the Degree in Mathematics.</p>
