I am an assistant professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)](http://www.uib.eu/). I am a member of the Mathematical Image Processing (TAMI) research group led by Prof. Bartomeu Coll and of the [Institute of Applied Computing and Community Code (IAC3)](http://iac3.uib.es). From July 2021, I am deputy director of the [Higher Polytechnic School](http://eps.uib.es/) and head of studies of the Degree in Mathematics.

I obtained my doctoral degree in 2016 from UIB with a thesis on variational models for ill-posed inverse problems in digital imaging. I have been a visiting researcher in the groups led by [Prof. Daniel Cremers](http://vision.in.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, [Prof. Jean-Michel Morel](http://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan/) at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay, and [Prof. Joan Bruna](http://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Data Science at New York University.

My main research interests include functional analysis, variational methods, convex optimization and deep learning with applications in image processing and computer vision. I am also interested in exploring the frontiers between mathematical modelling and learning based architectures for solving inverse problems.  

I have had a long-term collaboration with the french spatial agency [CNES](http://cnes.fr/en) by contributing to the image restoration chain of the Earth observation satellite [Pleiades](http://pleiades.cnes.fr/en/PLEIADES/index.htm). Together with TAMI colleagues, [Dr. Jamila Mifdal](http://jamilamifdal.com/) from the [$$\Phi$$-Lab](http://philab.phi.esa.int/) at the [European Spatial Agency (ESA)](http://www.esa.int), and members of the research team led by  [Prof. Salud Deudero](http://www.ba.ieo.es/es/personal/12-contacts/15-salud-deudero-company) from the [Oceanographic Centre of the Balearic Islands (COB)](http://www.ba.ieo.es), I am currently working on the design of deep unfolding networks for the fusion of remote sensing data and the automatic detection of floating objects in the Mediterranena Sea.

If you are a BsC/MsC student at UIB interested in pursuing your degree/master thesis in any of the fields of my research or in Functional Analysis, Partial Differential Equations or Calculus of Variations, visit my [teaching page](/teaching/).

If you are a BsC/MsC/PhD student looking for a research internship, contact me by email.
