I am an associate professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)](http://www.uib.eu/). I am a member of the Mathematical Image Processing (TAMI) research group and of the [Institute of Applied Computing and Community Code (IAC3)](http://iac3.uib.es). From July 2021, I am deputy director of the [Higher Polytechnic School](http://eps.uib.es/) and head of studies of the Degree in Mathematics.

My main research interests currently include nonlinear analysis, calculus of variations, partial differential equations, convex optimization, and deep unfolding architectures, with applications in image processing, satellite imaging, and computer vision. 

I have had a long-term collaboration with the french space agency [CNES](http://cnes.fr/en) by contributing to the image restoration chain of the Earth observation satellite [Pleiades](http://pleiades.cnes.fr/en/PLEIADES/index.htm). In collaboration with the [European Space Agency (ESA)](http://www.esa.int) and the [Oceanographic Centre of the Balearic Islands](http://www.ba.ieo.es), I am currently working on deep unfolding architectures for the fusion of remote sensing data and the automatic detection of floating objects in the Mediterranean Sea.

I have been a visiting researcher in the groups led by [Prof. Daniel Cremers](http://vision.in.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, [Prof. Jean-Michel Morel](http://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan/) at Centre de Math√©matiques et Leurs Applications at ENS Paris-Saclay, and [Prof. Joan Bruna](http://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and the Center for Data Science at New York University.

If you are BSc/MSc/PhD student looking for a research internship or a UIB student interested in pursuing your degree/master thesis with me, please visit my [mentoring page](/Mentoring/).
