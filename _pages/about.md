I am a tenure-track associate professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)](http://www.uib.eu/). I am a member of the Mathematical Image Processing research group and of the [Institute of Applied Computing and Community Code (IAC3)](http://iac3.uib.es).

I obtained my doctoral degree in 2016 from the UIB with a tesis on variational models for ill-posed inverse problems in digital imaging. I has been a visiting researcher in the groups headed by [Prof. Daniel Cremers](http://vision.in.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany), [Prof. Jean-Michel Morel](http://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan/)  at ENS Cachan, Paris, and [Prof. Joan Bruna](http://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) at Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences andCenter for Data Science at the New York University.


My main research interests include variational methods, optimization techniques and deep learning based algorithms for solving inverse problems in computer vision, image and video processing. I have taken part in several national research projects and I have collaborated with the french spatial agency (CNES) by contributing to the image restoration chain of the Earth observation satellite Pl√©iades.

<p>He has taught at the <a href="https://eps.uib.es/" target="_blank">Higher Polytechnic School</a> and at the <a href="https://fciencies.uib.cat/" target="_blank">Faculty of Science</a>, mainly in mathematical analysis and differential equations in the degrees in Mathematics, Computer Engineering, Chemistry and Biochemistry. He also teaches mathematical models for the restoration of digital images in the Master's Degree in Advanced Physics and Applied Mathematics.</p>
<p>From July 2021, he is deputy director of the Higher Polytechnic School and head of studies of the Degree in Mathematics.</p>
