I am an assistant professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)](http://www.uib.eu/). I am a member of the Mathematical Image Processing research group and of the [Institute of Applied Computing and Community Code (IAC3)](http://iac3.uib.es).

I obtained my doctoral degree in 2016 from UIB with a tesis on variational models for ill-posed inverse problems in digital imaging. I was a visiting researcher in the groups headed by [Prof. Daniel Cremers](http://vision.in.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, [Prof. Jean-Michel Morel](http://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan/) at Ecole Normale Supérieure Cachan Paris-Saclay and [Prof. Joan Bruna](http://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Data Science at the New York University.

My main research interests include variational methods, optimization techniques and deep learning based algorithms for solving inverse problems in computer vision, image and video processing. I have taken part in several national research projects and I have collaborated with the french spatial agency (CNES) by contributing to the image restoration chain of the Earth observation satellite Pléiades.
