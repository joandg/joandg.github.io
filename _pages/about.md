I am an assistant professor of Applied Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the [University of the Balearic Islands (UIB)](http://www.uib.eu/). I am a member of the Mathematical Image Processing research group and of the [Institute of Applied Computing and Community Code (IAC3)](http://iac3.uib.es).

I obtained my doctoral degree in 2016 from UIB with a tesis on variational models for ill-posed inverse problems in digital imaging. I has been a visiting researcher in the groups headed by [Prof. Daniel Cremers](http://vision.in.tum.de/) at the Technical University of Munich, [Prof. Jean-Michel Morel](http://sites.google.com/site/jeanmichelmorelcmlaenscachan/) at Ecole Normale Supérieure Cachan Paris-Saclay and [Prof. Joan Bruna](http://cims.nyu.edu/~bruna/) at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Center for Data Science at the New York University.

My main research interests include functional analysis, variational methods - particularly, nonlocal regularization-, convex optimization and machine learning techniques with applications in image processing and computer vision. Currently, I am also interested in the theoretical foundations of deep learning and in analyzing the frontiers between mathematical modelling and learning based architectures for solving inverse problems.  

I have had a long-term collaboration wih the french spatial agency [CNES](http://cnes.fr/en) by contributing to the image restoration chain of the Earth observation satellite [Pléiades](http://pleiades.cnes.fr/en/PLEIADES/index.htm). I am currently working with [Dr. Jamila Mifdal](http://jamilamifdal.com/) from the [$\Phi$-Lab](http://philab.phi.esa.int/) at the [European Spatial Agency (ESA)](http://www.esa.int) and the research team headed by  [Prof. Salud Deudero](http://www.ba.ieo.es/es/personal/12-contacts/15-salud-deudero-company) from the [Oceanographic Centre of the Balearic Islands (COB)](http://www.ba.ieo.es/es/investigacion/grupos-de-investigacion/impactsea) at IEO-CSIC  
on the design of deep unfolding networks for the fusion of remote sensing data and automatic detection of floating objects in the Mediterranena Sea.
