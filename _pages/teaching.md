For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!

All materials can be downloaded from UIB Digital. You are required to be a student at the Universitat de les Illes Balears (UIB) and be enrolled in the corresponding course to have access to all data.
